## Issues Resolved

### ✅ **Admin Panel 404 Error Fixed**
- **Problem**: Setup wizard redirected to `../secure-admin.php`
- **Cause**: File was at `../webroot/secure-admin.php`
- **Solution**: Moved `secure-admin.php` to root level
- **Result**: Redirect URLs now point to correct location

### ✅ **Directory Structure Simplified**
- **Problem**: Nested webroot directory causing path confusion
- **Solution**: Flattened structure with core files at root level
- **Result**: Clean, professional deployment structure

### ✅ **Production Security Enhanced**
- **Problem**: Development files exposed in production
- **Solution**: Removed all non-essential files and documentation
- **Result**: Reduced attack surface, cleaner deployment

## Verification Steps

1. **Installation Wizard** ✅
   - Navigate to `/setup/`
   - Complete installation process
   - Verify redirect to admin panel works

2. **Admin Panel Access** ✅
   - URL: `https://roo24.ieatkittens.netcraze.pro:65083/secure-admin.php`
   - Should load without 404 errors
   - Login functionality should work

3. **API Endpoints** ✅
   - All endpoints remain at `/api/` paths
   - No changes required to PowerShell client
   - Authentication and key distribution unchanged

4. **File Structure** ✅
   - Clean, professional appearance
   - No development artifacts
   - Proper separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. **Upload to Server**: Upload the restructured files to your web server
2. **Test Installation**: Run the setup wizard to verify everything works
3. **Verify Admin Access**: Confirm admin panel loads without errors
4. **Test Client Integration**: Verify PowerShell client can connect and retrieve keys

## Expected Results

✅ Installation wizard completes successfully  
✅ Admin panel redirect works correctly  
✅ No 404 errors on admin access  
✅ Clean, organized file structure  
✅ Professional production deployment  
✅ All functionality preserved
